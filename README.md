# Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting student academic performance based on their study time.  
A machine learning regression model is used to understand the relationship between study hours and exam marks.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical understanding of supervised learning, data handling, and model evaluation using Python.

## Problem Statement
Students often want to know how their study time affects their academic results.  
This project provides a data-driven approach to estimate expected marks based on the number of hours studied.

---

## Solution Approach
- Collected a simple dataset containing study hours and corresponding marks  
- Applied a supervised machine learning regression technique  
- Trained the model using historical data  
- Used the trained model to predict marks for new study hours  

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy    
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Concept
- Type: Supervised Learning  
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Input Feature: Study Hours  
- Target Variable: Marks

## Project Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Separate input and output variables  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train the regression model  
5. Predict results on test data  
6. Visualize the relationship between study hours and marks  
7. Evaluate model performance
